Musician to Developer

My apartment is full of instruments. There are more cases than places to sit, and a constant stream of new music coming out of one speaker or another.

As a music educator, of course I love to share music with others. Collaborating with friends, family and students is where I get the most joy out of the work that I do. So naturally, moving to Nashville on July 1, 2018 is something I am eager and ready to do. 

I have been independently studying, practicing and building apps using HTML, CSS and JS for the last six months, and the challenge of becoming proficient in yet another skill is a pursuit not unlike tacking a new musical instrument. 

Of course I want to be able to make beautiful, functional and desirable apps and websites right out of the gate, and better yet, get PAID for it. But I am taking things one step at a time and committing most of my free time to seeing far I can take this new skill into the next chapter of my life. 

Although I am new to coding and to GitHub, I will do my best to create a timeline of progress that is available for people to see, and throw me some pointers if they are feeling generous.
